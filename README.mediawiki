= SoundBox =
By Oliver Zemann, and (hopefuly soon) many awesome contributors!

SoundBox is a simple to use media player for streaming sites like Jamendo, MyMusic, YouTube, and others. 


== Getting Started (as user) ==
If you just want to download a binary release, checkout the [https://github.com/olze/SoundBox/downloads Download Page] from GitHub. I hope i can release a preview soon.

'''Requirements: '''

* '''JRE 1.5 and above, available [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html here].'''
* '''An extraction tool like [http://7-zip.org/ 7zip].'''

After downloading and extracting the archive, open a terminal (linux) or the commandline (windows) and enter these commands:

cd $newly_created_directory<ref name="ftn0">Mostly felix-framework-4.0.2</ref>

java -jar bin/felix.jar<ref name="ftn1">If you are on windows, please use \ instead of / </ref>

The SoundBox should start right now.

== Getting Started (as contributor) ==
If you want to contribute to the project, please contact me. There are many tasks that can be done, even without knowing what Java is ;)

For example writing Tutorials, creating a more beautiful README, internationalization (translating) … 

I will create some tutorials for developers soon.


== Technique ==
SoundBox is just a bunch of OSGi Bundles, communicating with each others. [http://www.osgi.org/Main/HomePage OSGi] is a specification for containers that handle such bundles (eg. loading/unloading/refreshing bundles, communication between bundles, …). There are some implementations out there, like Apache Felix (thats what i use), Equinox (what's working behind eclipse), Knopplerfish...
